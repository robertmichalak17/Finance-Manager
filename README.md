# Financial management app in C++
A financial management application written in C++ is a group project designed to help users manage their personal or business finances. It allows users to register and log into individual accounts, ensuring secure access to their financial data. After logging in, users can add income and expenses, categorize transactions (e.g., food, transport, bills), and generate summary reports. The app also include budgeting features. 

Developed in C++, the application ensures high performance and can handle large amounts of data.

It was built with a command-line interface (CLI).
