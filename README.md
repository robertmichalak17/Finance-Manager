# Financial management app in C++
A financial management application written in C++ allows users to register and log into individual accounts, ensuring secure access to personal financial data. Once logged in, users can add income and expenses, categorize transactions (e.g., food, transport, bills), and generate reports summarizing their financial situation. The app may also offer budgeting tools and trend analysis to help users better manage their finances. Thanks to the use of C++, the application runs efficiently and can handle large volumes of data. It can be implemented with a command-line interface (CLI).
